# Training-Time-and-Parameter-Costs-of-RNNs-Bi-LSTM-GRU-vs.-Conv1D-for-Sentiment-Analysis
Compares 3 architectures (Bi-LSTM, GRU, Conv1D) for sentiment analysis.  Objective: Evaluate trade-offs in prediction accuracy, training time, and complexity.  Methodology: Uses Keras for data prep (tokenization/padding) and benchmarking of each model's performance on a test set.
